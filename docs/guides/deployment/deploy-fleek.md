### What is Fleek ?


### What you need to get started:
* We'll be using the [Polywrap Demos](https://github.com/polywrap/demos) repo for this guide. 
* ðŸ’š [Node. js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 
* ðŸ§¶[Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/)
    * Versions:  `node >=10.0.0` or `yarn >=1.0.0`
* ðŸ”¸ [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)


### Step 1. Clone the polywrap demo project  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/polywrap/demos.git
```

### Step 2. Git pull metadata
Then, we will check out the demo branch with the metafiles already set up:

```bash
git pull origin polywrap-metadata
```

### Step 3. Build the wrapper
Now, we can build the sample Polywrapper with the following commands:

```bash
nvm use
yarn
yarn build
```

Your `build` folder should be generated now. Copy and paste the `./web3api.meta.yaml` and `./meta` files into the `build` folder.

### Step 4.  **Upload the build folder to Fleek**

On the left-hand menu of your Fleek account page, click on the "Storage" link.

Then, click "Create Folder" and name it anything you'd like.

After that, click "Upload" to begin uploading the contents of your `build` folder onto Fleek.

### Step 5.  **Verifying the package on IPFS**

Click the "Verify on IPFS" button. You will get an IPFS hash! 

For an example of what you should see, visit this [IPFS link](https://ipfs.fleek.co/ipfs/QmQLsx7sxkLrXwh8dPmF2MTWJmgB5C2FmWYth11i7oL3vN).

Now that you have the IPFS hash, you can use it as a value in the URI property of your Polywrap queries to access the mutation and query functions on this Polywrapper. You can also register an ENS domain and have it resolved to this IPFS content.
