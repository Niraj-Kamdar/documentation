The Polywrap JavaScript client exists to help developers integrate wrappers into their applications. It's designed to run in any environment that can execute JavaScript (think websites, node scripts, etc.).

## Installation

```bash
npm install @web3api/client-js
```

## Usage

Use an `import` or `require` statement, depending on which your environment supports.

```js
$snippet: js-import-client
```

Then, you will be able to use the `Web3ApiClient` like so:

```js
$snippet: js-client-query
```
