Once the Polywrap JS client has been installed, the next step is to create a `Web3ApiClient` instance:

```typescript
$snippet: js-create-client-instance
```

At this point, you can already send queries to Polywraps. In the simple example below, we send one to the "hello world" Polywrap.

```typescript
$snippet: js-client-hello-world
```
