**Polywrap** is a framework for developing software powered by Wraps. Wraps are software modules that are:

1. **Portable** - can run in any environment
2. **Composable** - can easily and safely call into one another

We believe that the future of software will be driven by a multitude of highly-specialized, platform-agnostic modules rather than monoliths.

Polywrap comes with:

- Clients - for interacting with Wraps from any environment. 
  We currently have clients available in JS, Python, Rust, Go, Kotlin, Swift, C#
- CLI - for integrating, building, and deploying Wraps

Currently, Polywrap is being used for:
- Web3: Bridging the gap between web2 & web3
- AI: Giving AI the ability to execute real-world business logic
