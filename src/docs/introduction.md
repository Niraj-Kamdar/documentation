**Polywrap** is a framework for developing software powered by Wraps. Wraps are software modules that are:

- **Portable** - run in any environment
- **Composable** - easily and safely call into one another

We believe that the future of software will be driven by a multitude of highly-specialized, platform-agnostic modules rather than monoliths.

Polywrap comes with:

- [**Clients**](/clients.md) - for interacting with Wraps from any environment
- [**CLI**](/cli.md) - for integrating, building, and deploying Wraps

Currently, Polywrap is being used for:
- [**Web3**](/use-cases/web3.md) - bringing web3 protocols into all types of apps
- [**AI**](/use-cases/ai.md) - enabling AI to learn and compose together new actions
