title: WRAP Standards
---

The Polywrap Foundation has created and actively maintains a series of standards that all WRAP-compatible clients must adhere to.

With Polywrap being an early-stage project, these standards are subject to change, but any change should be non-breaking and purely additive in nature.

[Read more about the WRAP Standards on their Github repository.](https://github.com/polywrap/specification)
